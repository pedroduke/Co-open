Abstract
</h2>

This project was developed under the curricular unit of Project II of the 3rd year of the Bachelor Degree of Multimedia Information Technologies, attended at the School of Technologies of Castelo Branco.
Mobile applications and online platforms are an essential product nowadays, but certain applications turn out to be somewhat limited, not covering all the needs of the various types of existing users, allowing this way the possibility of developing other types and new online platforms and mobile applications to meet the needs of a new target audience that is underdeveloped at the moment.

One of the biggest difficulties of the new artists is to be able to sell and share their work with the world, in order to achieve a more stable life, the great majority of artists want to share their work and be recognized for their commitment and dedication in their form of expression, as well as travel and know new cultures in which they can learn and get inspiration to develop new projects, another important factor is the contacts, having contacts itâ€™s easier to an artist share, sell and connect their work and ideologies to the world as well to other artists, this way it gives opportunities for new collaborations.

The main function of this project aims the connection between artists, curators, galleries and volunteers who make themselves available to give these artists a stay from an online platform which allows the creation of these different types of profiles, make the possibility to follow artists, galleries, curators and volunteers, giving the opportunity to exchange messages to requests a stay, exhibit their work in other city or country and share mutual interests.
